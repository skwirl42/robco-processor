# robco-processor
> an emulated fantasy computer system inspired by the terminals found in the Fallout universe

A bit of an expansion on the ideas in https://github.com/skwirl42/robco-os including an ISA for a stack-based processor.

Requirements:
- macOS 10.15+ with dev tools installed (could probably be easily ported to other platforms/versions)
- SDL2
- SDL2_image
- CMake 3.0+
